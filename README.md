# Prodigy-Infotech-Task-2

As a Data Science Intern at Prodigy InfoTech, I was tasked with performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

Here's a detailed overview of the steps I took and the insights I gained:

## Data Cleaning

### Step 1: Importing the Dataset
I started by importing the Titanic dataset from Kaggle using Python.

### Step 2: Data Inspection
I inspected the dataset to understand its structure and identify any missing values.

### Step 3: Handling Missing Values
I handled missing values in the dataset by filling them with the median value for numerical columns and the most frequent value for categorical columns.

### Step 4: Data Visualization
I visualized the dataset to understand the distribution of variables and identify any patterns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Step 1: Descriptive Statistics
I calculated descriptive statistics to get a snapshot of the dataset.

### Step 2: Visualizing Relationships
I visualized the relationships between variables to identify patterns and trends.

### Step 3: Identifying Patterns
I identified patterns in the data by analyzing the distributions and relationships between variables.

## Insights Gained

- **Age Distribution**: The age distribution showed a positive skew, indicating that most passengers were in their 20s and 30s.
- **Survival by Sex**: The survival rate was higher for males than females, with a significant difference in survival rates between the two sexes.
- **Embarked Locations**: The majority of passengers embarked from Southampton, with fewer from Cherbourg and Queenstown.

## Conclusion
Performing data cleaning and EDA on the Titanic dataset allowed me to uncover valuable insights into the demographics and survival rates of passengers. This process is crucial for understanding the dataset and identifying potential relationships and patterns that can inform further analysis and modeling.
